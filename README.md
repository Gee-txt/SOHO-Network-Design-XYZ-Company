# SOHO-Network-Design-XYZ-Company

This project is part of my CCNA post-course practice, where I applied core networking concepts to design a Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) network for a fictional fast-growing company called XYZ.

## 🏢 Scenario

XYZ is expanding into a new branch near Bonalbo village in Eastern Australia. They require a network setup that:
- Uses 1 Cisco Router and 1 Cisco Switch.
- Supports 3 departments: Admin/IT, Finance/HR, and Customer Service/Reception.
- Separates departments using VLANs.
- Provides wireless connectivity for all departments.
- Uses DHCP to assign IPv4 addresses.
- Allows inter-department communication.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer
- VLANs & Inter-VLAN Routing
- DHCP (Router-based)
- Wireless Access Point simulation
- Static Default Route to ISP

## 🔍 What I Learned

- Planning subnetting and VLANs from a given base IP
- Configuring DHCP pools and wireless support
- Understanding router-on-a-stick implementation
- Bridging design with business needs in a realistic use-case
